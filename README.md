<p align="center"> Pi-Hole & Unbound install script.
    <br>
</p>


## ðŸ¤” Why?

I've used An ADBlocker for years and as of recently started using it as my recursive DNS as well. I thought what better way than to make a script that setups up the Unbound portion and add some extra tools I use with it.

## :gear: Instructions

- Make sure dependencies are installed.

```shell
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install git curl
```

- Clone the repo
```shell
git clone https://github.com/coloredbytes/nocookies4u.git
```

- Run the script
```shell
./install.sh
```

## What the script does.

- Installs Pi-Hole & Unbound based off [docs](https://docs.pi-hole.net/guides/dns/unbound/) here.

- Installs a white list based off this [project](https://github.com/anudeepND/whitelist.git).

## ðŸŽ‰ Acknowledgements

Thanks to [omgrubberduck](https://github.com/omgrubberduck) for showing me the whitelist project.
